# Student-Management-System
Overview

This C++ application is designed to manage student records efficiently. It allows users to:

Add new students
Display all student information
Calculate average marks for each student
Sort students by average marks
Find the student with the highest and lowest average marks
Calculate the class average
How to Use

Compile: Use a C++ compiler like code blocks to compile the code.
Run: Execute the compiled program.
Interact: Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various operations.
Key Features

Data Structure: Uses a struct to store student information (name, age, marks, average).
Input/Output: Employs cin and cout for user interaction.
Array-Based Storage: Uses arrays to store multiple student records.
Looping: Utilizes for and while loops for iterative operations.
Function-Based Design: Organizes code into functions for modularity and reusability.
Error Handling: Includes basic input validation to ensure data integrity.
Potential Enhancements

File I/O: Implement file operations to save and load student data.
GUI: Develop a graphical user interface for a more user-friendly experience.
Advanced Sorting Algorithms: Explore more efficient sorting algorithms like quicksort or merge sort.
Data Validation: Add more robust input validation to prevent invalid data entry.
Security: Implement security measures to protect sensitive student information.
Additional Notes

The code is well-commented to enhance readability and understanding.
Consider using more descriptive variable names for better code clarity.
Explore object-oriented programming concepts to further structure the code.
By following these guidelines and incorporating the suggested enhancements, you can create a more robust and feature-rich student management system.
